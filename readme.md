# AngularJS generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-angular.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-angular)

Maintainer: [Brian Ford](https://github.com/btford)

Based on [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/)


## Usage

Install `generator-angular`:
```
npm install -g generator-angular
```

Make a new directory, and `cd` into it:
```
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Run `yo angular`, optionally passing an app name:
```
yo angular [app-name]
```

## Generators

Available generators:

* [angular](#app) (aka [angular:app](#app))
* [angular:controller](#controller)
* [angular:directive](#directive)
* [angular:filter](#filter)
* [angular:route](#route)
* [angular:service](#service)
* [angular:view](#view)

**Note: Generators are to be run from the root directory of your app.**

### App
Sets up a new AngularJS app, generating all the boilerplate you need to get started. The app generator also optionally installs Twitter Bootstrap and additional AngularJS modules, such as angular-resource.

Example:
```bash
yo angular
```

### Route
Generates a controller and view, and configures a route in `app/scripts/app.js` connecting them.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:route myroute
```

Produces `app/scripts/controllers/myroute.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('MyrouteCtrl', function ($scope) {
  // ...
});
```

Produces `app/views/myroute.html`:
```html
<p>This is the myroute view</p>
```

### Controller
Generates a controller in `app/scripts/controllers`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:controller user
```

Produces `app/scripts/controllers/user.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('UserCtrl', function ($scope) {
  // ...
});
```
### Directive
Generates a directive in `app/scripts/directives`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:directive myDirective
```

Produces `app/scripts/directives/myDirective.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').directive('myDirective', function () {
  return {
    template: '<div></div>',
    restrict: 'E',
    link: function postLink(scope, element, attrs) {
      element.text('this is the myDirective directive');
    }
  };
});
```

### Filter
Generates a filter in `app/scripts/filters`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:filter myFilter
```

Produces `app/scripts/filters/myFilter.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').filter('myFilter', function () {
  return function (input) {
    return 'myFilter filter:' + input;
  };
});
```

### View
Generates an HTML view file in `app/views`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:view user
```

Produces `app/views/user.html`:
```html
<p>This is the user view</p>
```

### Service
Generates an AngularJS service.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:service myService
```

Produces `app/scripts/services/myService.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').factory('myService', function () {
  // ...
});
```

#### Options
There are options for each of the methods for registering services. For more on using these services, see the [module API AngularJS documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.Module).

##### Factory
Invoked with `--factory`

This is the default method when creating a service. Running `yo angular:service myService --factory` is the same as running `yo angular:service myService`

##### Service
Invoked with `--service`

##### Value
Invoked with `--value`

##### Constant
Invoked with `--constant`

## Options
In general, these options can be applied to any generator, though they only affect generators that produce scripts.

### CoffeeScript
For generators that output scripts, the `--coffee` option will output CoffeeScript instead of JavaScript.

For example:
```bash
yo angular:controller user --coffee
```

Produces `app/scripts/controller/user.coffee`:
```coffeescript
angular.module('myMod')
  .controller 'UserCtrl', ($scope) ->
```

A project can mix CoffeScript and JavaScript files.

### Minification Safe
By default, generators produce unannotated code. Without annotations, AngularJS's DI system will break when minified. Typically, these annotations the make minification safe are added automatically at build-time, after application files are concatenated, but before they are minified. By providing the `--minsafe` option, the code generated will out-of-the-box be ready for minification. The trade-off is between amount of boilerplate, and build process complexity.

#### Example
```bash
yo angular:controller user --minsafe
```

Produces `app/controller/user.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('UserCtrl', ['$scope', function ($scope) {
  // ...
}]);
```

#### Background
Unannotated:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('MyCtrl', function ($scope, $http, myService) {
  // ...
});
```

Annotated:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('MyCtrl',
  ['$scope', '$http', 'myService', function ($scope, $http, myService) {

    // ...
  }]);
```

The annotations are important because minified code will rename variables, making it impossible for AngularJS to infer module names based solely on function parameters.

The recommended build process uses `ngmin`, a tool that automatically adds these annotations. However, if you'd rather not use `ngmin`, you have to add these annotations manually yourself.

## Bower Components

The following packages are always installed by the [app](#app) generator:

* angular
* angular-mocks
* angular-scenario


The following additional modules are available as components on bower, and installable via `bower install`:

* angular-cookies
* angular-loader
* angular-resource
* angular-sanitize

All of these can be updated with `bower update` as new versions of AngularJS are released.

## Configuration
Yeoman generated projects can be further tweaked according to your needs by modifying project files appropriately.

### Output
You can change the `app` directory by adding a `appPath` property to `component.json`. For instance, if you wanted to easily integrate with Express.js, you could add the following:

```json
{
  "name": "yo-test",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  ...
  "appPath": "public"
}

```
This will cause Yeoman-generated client-side files to be placed in `public`.

## Testing

For tests to work properly, karma needs the `angular-mocks` bower package.
This script is included in the component.json in the `devDependencies` section, which will
be available very soon, probably with the next minor release of bower.

While bower `devDependencies` are not yet implemented, you can fix it by running:
```bash
bower install angular-mocks
```

By running `grunt test` you should now be able to run your unit tests with karma.
